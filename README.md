A series of complete processes for OBS data preprocessing
=========================================================
This open-source project establishes a `standardized process` for OBS data processing,`taking IGGOBS as an example`, forming software modules for the preprocessing of both active and passive source OBS data.
All code is developed based on the `Python environment`, making the deck implementation of OBS data preprocessing possible.
The complete process program will be uploaded sequentially.
